Implemented an `addPoint` function that increments a user's points by 1.\n3. Added a `getPoints` function to retrieve a user's current points.\n4. Implemented basic access control using OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract.\n5. Added an `authorizedFrontend` address that can also call the `addPoint` function.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The contract assumes that points should only be incremented by authorized parties (owner or authorized frontend) to prevent abuse.\n- Initially, the `authorizedFrontend` is set to the contract deployer's address.\n\nInstructions for deployment and interaction:\n1. Deploy the contract.\n2. Use the `setAuthorizedFrontend` function to set the address of your frontend application if it's different from the deployer's address.\n3. The frontend should call `addPoint` whenever a user clicks, passing the user's address.\n4. Anyone can call `getPoints` to retrieve a user's current points.\n\nRemember to replace the initial `authorizedFrontend` address with your actual frontend address after deployment for security reasons.\n",
