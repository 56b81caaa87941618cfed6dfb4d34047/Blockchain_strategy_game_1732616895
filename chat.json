Allows users to input token addresses to get or create pairs\n4. Displays the results of these function calls\n5. Includes error handling and user feedback\n\nPlease note that creating a pair requires the user to have a connected wallet with sufficient ETH for gas fees. Also, the createPair function may fail if the pair already exists or if there are issues with the provided token addresses.\n\nThe component uses inline Tailwind CSS for styling as requested. You may need to adjust some styling or layout to fit your specific design requirements.\n",
